# Breakie

Breakie is a web based application that builds communities through sharing breakfasts.

## Why Breakie?
The new generation of Singaporeans nowadays rarely eat breakfast, especially during the rush hours. What if you could literally go next door and pick up a home made breakfast? Zero hassle, no time wasted.

Ever had the thought that you made wayyyy too much breakfast for yourself just to end up throwing it away? Wouldn't it be great if you could share it and earn money at the same time instead?

Sharing is caring! Exchange homemade breakfast with your neighbours and interact with the community at the same time! The main purpose of this project is to increase community spirits and interaction.
