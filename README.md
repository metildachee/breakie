# breakie - made with love, from next door

breakie is a web based application that builds communities through sharing breakfasts.

## Why breakie?
The new generation of Singaporeans nowadays rarely eat breakfast, especially during the rush hours. On the other hand, many cooking enthusiasts often make piping hot breakfast, but can't finish it alone; and all the effort goes to waste. What if there was a way to close the gap? What if, the busy bee could literally, go next door to collect freshly made breakfast, with a minimal fee.

Sharing is caring! Exchange homemade breakfast with your neighbours and interact with the community at the same time! The main purpose of this project is to increase community spirits and interaction.
